HOW THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK BE COMPILED

The jupyter notebook named 'Final_Project.ipynb' imports two python files
The variables.py and the functions.py file
variables.py file encloses all the initial and observational parameters
function.py file encloses all the functions that were used for this work.

The Jupyter Notebook (Final_Project) must be on the same folder with these two files for it to
compile with out errors.
